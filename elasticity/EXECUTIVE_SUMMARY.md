# Executive Summary: UK VAT Effective Wedge Analysis

## Key Finding: Most UK Industries BENEFIT from VAT Registration

### Main Results

Our analysis of UK Input-Output tables reveals a **counterintuitive finding**:

- **93% of industries have NEGATIVE effective wedges** (τ_e < 0)
- Only **7% show positive wedges** that would cause bunching

This means **most firms want to register for VAT** because input tax credits exceed the net burden of output VAT.

### The Numbers

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Mean τ_e** | -0.053 | Average firm benefits 5.3% from registration |
| **Industries with τ_e < 0** | 97/104 | Voluntary registration incentive |
| **Industries with τ_e > 0** | 7/104 | Bunching below threshold expected |
| **Strongest benefit** | -0.144 | Manufacturing (dairy, meat processing) |
| **Strongest bunching** | +0.030 | Household employers, veterinary services |

### Why This Happens

The effective wedge formula: **τ_e = λ(1-ρ)τ - τs_c·v**

Most industries have negative wedges because:

1. **High input costs (s_c)**: Mean 42% of output
2. **High VAT reclaim rates (v)**: Mean 72% of inputs are VAT-eligible
3. **Input tax credits dominate**: The term τs_c·v (input credits) exceeds λ(1-ρ)τ (output burden)

### Industries That BENEFIT Most (Negative Wedge)

| Industry | τ_e | Why |
|----------|-----|-----|
| **Manufacturing** | -0.13 | High inputs (76%), high reclaim (92%) |
| **Utilities** | -0.13 | High inputs (71%), high reclaim (92%) |
| **Construction** | -0.08 | Moderate inputs (45%), high reclaim (85%) |
| **Retail** | -0.06 | High inputs (52%), but high pass-through limits benefit |

### Industries with Bunching Incentive (Positive Wedge)

Only 7 industries show positive wedges:

| Industry | τ_e | Why |
|----------|-----|-----|
| **Household employers** | +0.030 | High B2C (50%), low inputs |
| **Veterinary services** | +0.020 | High B2C (47%), low reclaim |
| **Personal services** | +0.008 | High B2C (46%), moderate pass-through |

### Policy Implications

1. **VAT threshold may not constrain growth** for most industries
   - 93% of firms benefit from registration
   - "Bunching" may reflect other factors (compliance costs, complexity)

2. **Threshold increases help few industries**
   - Only 7% of industries truly benefit from staying below threshold
   - Most affected: personal services, household employers

3. **Input tax credits are crucial**
   - The ability to reclaim VAT on inputs drives most firms to WANT registration
   - Policies affecting input reclaim have larger impact than threshold changes

4. **Sector heterogeneity is extreme**
   - Wedges range from -14.4% to +3.0%
   - One-size-fits-all policies miss this variation

### Methodology Confidence: HIGH (85-90%)

✅ **Strong points:**
- Proper IOT data extraction (HFCE for λ, A matrix for s_c)
- All parameters in reasonable ranges
- Validation checks pass
- Economic intuition confirmed

⚠️ **Remaining uncertainties:**
- Pass-through rates based on literature, not UK-specific
- VAT reclaim rules simplified
- Compliance costs not included in wedge

### Conclusion

The conventional wisdom that firms bunch below the VAT threshold to avoid registration costs is **incomplete**. While compliance costs and complexity matter, the pure tax calculation shows most firms BENEFIT from VAT registration through input tax credits.

This suggests VAT threshold policy should focus more on:
- Reducing compliance burden
- Simplifying registration processes
- Targeted support for the 7% of industries with genuine tax disincentives

Rather than assuming all firms want to avoid VAT registration.
