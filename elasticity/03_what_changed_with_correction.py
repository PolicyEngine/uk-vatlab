print("1. λ values are now MORE VARIED:")

print("3. What we learned:")
print("   - Column 118 (TU) is NOT total output")
print("   - We need to sum all destination columns manually")
print("   - But even with correct λ, most industries still benefit from VAT\n")

print("THE REAL ISSUE:")
print("-" * 50)
print("The model τ_e = λ(1-ρ)τ - τs_c·v is probably INCOMPLETE")
print("\nIt captures only the TAX wedge but misses:")
print("1. Compliance costs (C): £3-5k fixed + time")
print("2. Administrative burden (A): 10-20 hours/month")
print("3. Cash flow impacts: VAT paid before received")
print("4. Uncertainty costs: Audit risk, penalties\n")

print("COMPLETE MODEL SHOULD BE:")
print("τ_e_full = λ(1-ρ)τ - τs_c·v + C/Y + A + F")
print("Where:")
print("  C/Y = Compliance cost as % of turnover")
print("  A = Administrative time cost")
print("  F = Cash flow and uncertainty costs\n")

print("BOTTOM LINE:")
print("-" * 50)
print("The correction fixed our λ calculation methodology,")
print("but revealed that the formula itself is incomplete.")
print("We need to add compliance costs to explain bunching.")
