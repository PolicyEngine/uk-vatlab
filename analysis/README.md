# Synthetic Firm Data Generation

This document explains the methodology for generating synthetic UK business data that combines ONS (Office for National Statistics) business structure with HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) validation statistics.

## Overview

We create individual firm records that preserve the detailed structure from ONS data while exactly matching the total counts from HMRC data. This solves a critical data science challenge: ONS provides rich sector × size detail but overestimates totals, while HMRC provides accurate totals but less structural detail.

## The Core Challenge: Misaligned Band Definitions

**ONS Turnover Bands** (from business survey data):
- `0-49k`, `50-99k`, `100-249k`, `250-499k`, `500-999k`, `1000-4999k`, `5000k+`

**HMRC Turnover Bands** (from VAT registration data):
- `Negative_or_Zero`, `£1_to_Threshold`, `£Threshold_to_£150k`, `£150k_to_£300k`, `£300k_to_£500k`, `£500k_to_£1m`, `£1m_to_£10m`, `Greater_than_£10m`

These bands don't align, making direct comparison impossible. Our methodology solves this through individual firm generation and re-mapping.

## Methodology: 5-Step Calibration Process

### Step 1: Generate Individual Firms from ONS Structure

Instead of working with aggregate band counts, we generate individual firms with specific turnover values:

```python
# ONS says: 10,000 firms in "Manufacturing, 100-249k" band
# We generate 10,000 individual firms with realistic turnovers between 100-249k

ONS Band "100-249k" → Individual Firms:
- Firm A: Manufacturing, £120k turnover
- Firm B: Manufacturing, £180k turnover  
- Firm C: Manufacturing, £230k turnover
- ... (9,997 more firms)
```

**Why this works**: Once we have individual turnover values, we can map them to any band system.

### Step 2: Map Individual Firms to HMRC Bands

Each firm gets mapped to HMRC bands using precise turnover thresholds:

```python
def map_to_hmrc_band(turnover_k):
    if turnover_k <= 90:        # VAT threshold ~£90k
        return '£1_to_Threshold'
    elif turnover_k <= 150:
        return '£Threshold_to_£150k'  
    elif turnover_k <= 300:
        return '£150k_to_£300k'
    # ... etc
```

**Example mapping**:
- Firm A (£120k) → `£Threshold_to_£150k` 
- Firm B (£180k) → `£150k_to_£300k`
- Firm C (£230k) → `£150k_to_£300k`

**Result**: We can now count how many ONS-generated firms fall into each HMRC band.

### Step 3: Calculate Calibration Factors

Compare ONS-derived counts with HMRC targets for each dimension:

#### A. Turnover Band Calibration
```python
# Example (realistic numbers):
# HMRC target for '£150k_to_£300k': 180,000 firms
# ONS-generated in '£150k_to_£300k': 220,000 firms
# band_factor = 180,000 / 220,000 = 0.82

# This means firms in this band are OVER-represented in ONS data
# They should have 82% selection probability
```

#### B. Sector Calibration  
```python
# Example:
# HMRC target for Retail (SIC 47110): 85,000 firms
# ONS-generated Retail firms: 100,000 firms  
# sector_factor = 85,000 / 100,000 = 0.85

# Retail firms are OVER-represented in ONS data
# They should have 85% selection probability
```

#### C. Combined Weights
```python
# For each individual firm:
combined_weight = (band_factor + sector_factor) / 2

# Example firm: Retail business with £200k turnover
# band_factor = 0.82 (from '£150k_to_£300k' band - over-represented)
# sector_factor = 0.85 (from retail sector - over-represented)
# combined_weight = (0.82 + 0.85) / 2 = 0.835

# This firm has 83.5% normal selection probability (less likely to be chosen)
```

### Step 4: Sector-Stratified Weighted Resampling

The key innovation: we don't randomly sample firms. Instead, we use calibration weights as selection probabilities within each sector:

```python
# For each sector separately:
for sector in sectors:
    # Get HMRC target count for this sector
    target_count = hmrc_sector_targets[sector]  # e.g., 85,000 retail firms
    
    # Get all ONS firms in this sector  
    sector_firms = ons_firms[ons_firms.sector == sector]  # e.g., 100,000 retail firms
    
    # Get their calibration weights
    weights = sector_firms['calibration_weight']  # e.g., [0.83, 0.85, 0.81, ...]
    
    # Convert to probabilities (normalize to sum to 1)
    probabilities = weights / weights.sum()
    
    # Sample exactly the HMRC target count using weights
    selected_firms = np.random.choice(
        sector_firms, 
        size=target_count,     # Exactly 85,000 firms
        replace=True,          # Allow same firm to be selected multiple times
        p=probabilities        # Higher weight = higher selection chance
    )
```

**Why this works**:
- **High weight firms** (under-represented): Selected multiple times
- **Low weight firms** (over-represented): Often not selected
- **Result**: Distribution shifts toward HMRC targets while preserving sector structure

### Step 5: Final Band Adjustments

After weighted resampling, we make targeted adjustments to fix any remaining band mismatches:

```python
# Check final band distribution vs HMRC targets
for band in hmrc_bands:
    current_count = count_synthetic_firms_in_band(band)
    target_count = hmrc_targets[band]
    
    if abs(current_count - target_count) > threshold:
        # Move firms between bands by adjusting their turnover values
        adjust_firm_turnovers_to_target_band(band, needed_adjustment)
```

## Realistic Example with Numbers

Let's trace through a complete example:

### Initial State (After ONS Generation)
```
Total ONS firms generated: 2,800,000
Total HMRC target: 2,200,000

Band: £150k_to_£300k
- ONS-generated count: 220,000 firms
- HMRC target: 180,000 firms  
- Band factor: 180,000 ÷ 220,000 = 0.82

Sector: Retail  
- ONS-generated count: 320,000 firms
- HMRC target: 250,000 firms
- Sector factor: 250,000 ÷ 320,000 = 0.78
```

### Calibration Weights
```
Example firm: Retail store with £200k turnover
- Band factor: 0.82 (£150k-£300k band over-represented)
- Sector factor: 0.78 (retail over-represented)
- Combined weight: (0.82 + 0.78) ÷ 2 = 0.80
- Selection probability: 80% of normal
```

### Resampling Result
```
Retail sector resampling:
- Target: 250,000 firms (HMRC)
- Available: 320,000 firms (ONS-generated)
- High-weight firms: Selected 1-2 times each
- Low-weight firms: Many not selected
- Result: Exactly 250,000 retail firms ✓

£150k_to_£300k band result:
- Started with: 220,000 firms
- After weighted sampling: ~180,000 firms ✓
```
